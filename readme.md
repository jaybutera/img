# Sangha

#### A way to share a collection photos and videos by name.

## What is it?
Sangha is essentially an open wiki for media. Anybody can create a topic by adding photos to it. The topic is an easily accessible url by anyone that knows it exists. Multiple people can upload to a single topic. It's an easy way to share photos with friends around an event, like a trip you took together, or an idea like cool art you find.

Sangha also makes downloading the images easy so they aren't locked in the cloud. It also serves raw images at an endpoint which other tools can access and build on top of. Such tools may provide better UI's for viewing and organizing photos, or perhaps be a native app. Sangha stores images without compressing, the original quality is preserved.

## Why does this exist?
Currently there's no organized and secure way to share photos. The choices are to host photos on the cloud like Google photos, but the photos are then compressed and difficult to get back off the cloud. It's also not easy to pass an album around and have people add to it. Group messaging apps like Telegram and Signal are also used but photos are not organized and get lost between the messages. Photos are also only hosted on people's phones and so may be lost. It's also again not easy to share.
